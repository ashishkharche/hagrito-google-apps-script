# Cache API Custom Function Currency Convert

This code fetches the current exchange rate from a financial information server using a third-party [exchange rate API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/). This is done using Apps Script services like [`UrlFetchApp`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/) and [`CacheService`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service).

## NOTE

The API url does not work as it requires API key and paid plan for the usage.

In future, consider using another API with suitable Free tier to test above code.

**THE CODE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.**
